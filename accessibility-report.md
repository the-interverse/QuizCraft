## Principles of Universal Design

### 1. Equitable Use
- QuizCraft is designed to be accessible to users with varying abilities. For instance, the interface is straightforward and easy to navigate, which accommodates users with limited technical experience.
- **Future implementation**: Adding high-contrast themes would further ensure the tool is usable by individuals with visual impairments or other disabilities.

### 2. Flexibility in Use
- The program allows users to upload course materials in various formats (e.g., pdf or plaintext) to create quizzes, providing flexibility based on user needs.
- **Future implementation**: Adding support for multiple languages and more input formats like DOCX could enhance accessibility for a broader audience.

### 3. Simple and Intuitive Use
- QuizCraft's user interface prioritizes simplicity, ensuring that even first-time users can create and take quizzes without extensive guidance.
- **Future implementation**: Adding contextual help tips or an onboarding tutorial could further simplify the user experience.

### 4. Perceptible Information
- Clear labels, tooltips, and consistent design help ensure that all users can perceive and interact with the interface effectively.
- **Future implementation**: Ensuring screen reader compatibility will make the program more accessible to users with visual impairments.

### 5. Tolerance for Error
- The program prevents critical errors by validating inputs, such as ensuring all required fields are completed before proceeding.
- **Future implementation**: Adding an "undo" feature or warnings before deletion would provide users with more security when making changes.

### 6. Low Physical Effort
- The user interface minimizes the amount of interaction required to perform tasks, such as generating quizzes or navigating the dashboard.
- **Future implementation**: Adding keyboard shortcuts and optimizing for assistive technologies would help users with limited mobility.

### 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use

## Accessibility Across Demographics

QuizCraft could face barriers for some demographics. For example, users without reliable internet access may struggle to use the platform if cloud storage or other online components are required. Additionally, users with severe visual or motor impairments may find it less accessible unless assistive features like screen reader support, keyboard navigation, or voice controls are implemented. To mitigate this, future updates should prioritize compatibility with assistive technologies and offline functionality to ensure that QuizCraft is usable by a diverse range of individuals, regardless of ability or access to resources.
